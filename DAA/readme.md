The following are the expected project deliverables that must be in Canvas. Please zip your folder containing all your files before submitting to Canvas.

A completed project report  which contains details about your project, such as main data structures, main components of the algorithm (different functions and what they do), design of the user-interface (if applicable, GUI is not required), experimental results, e.g. charts of running time versus input size, etc.
You should also turn in your code and associated documentation (e.g. README files) so that everything can be backed up for future reference
Your inputs (graphs, trees or arrays) should also be included (Do not hard code inputs). You can also use random generators to make inputs for sorting algorithms.
 

Implement and compare the following algorithms. How their running times change with respect to data size? How their speed compare to each other in the cases with different data size? Can you improve their running time with your discovery? Which one is better in terms what conditions?

Implement and compare the following sorting algorithm :

Mergesort
 Heapsort
Quicksort (Regular quick sort* and quick sort using 3 medians)
Insertion sort
Selection sort
Bubble sort
* For regular quick sort you can decide between choosing first, last or a random element as pivot. But you need to include both regular and 3 medians as separate algorithms.
